    Vacuum levels (``material == "vacuum"``) are skipped: the AEDT background
    region is already vacuum and any vacuum box is added explicitly with
    :meth:`qpdk.simulation.hfss.HFSS.add_air_region`, so importing vacuum as
    GDS geometry is redundant. This also resolves the Substrate/Vacuum
    collision on ``LAYER.SIM_AREA`` (98, 0).

    pyaedt's ``import_gds_3d`` keys the mapping on GDS layer number only — the
    GDS datatype is not part of the key — so two levels sharing a layer number
    (e.g. ``LAYER.AB_DRAW`` = (10, 0) and ``LAYER.AB_VIA`` = (10, 1)) are merged
    into a single entry when they share a material and their z-spans join into
    one box; otherwise an error is raised rather than silently importing wrong
    geometry. Levels sharing a layer number are processed in ascending
    ``zmin`` order so the result does not depend on the layer stack's
    insertion order.
