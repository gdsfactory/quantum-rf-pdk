r"""Add an electrostatic capacitance study to a COMSOL model that uses metal sheets.

The model comes from
:func:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol_sheet.build_comsol_sheet_model`, where the metal
is a set of faces on the silicon/air interface. This module picks those faces out
with points inside them, drives one of them with a voltage terminal, grounds the
others, and adds a mesh sequence and a stationary study. Nothing is solved here,
and nothing here is specific to a device: the caller names the conductors, which
one is driven, and which are grounded.

A solve gives electrostatic capacitance: ``es.C11`` is the capacitance of the
driven conductor to the grounded rest of the chip, and the stored energy agrees
with it, since :math:`2 W_e / V^2` equals ``es.C11``. It is not an RF Josephson
eigenmode, and turning it into a qubit frequency needs an :math:`L_J` picked
outside COMSOL: that LC estimate is not an eigensolve.
