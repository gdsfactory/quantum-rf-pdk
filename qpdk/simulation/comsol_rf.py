r"""Add an unsolved CPW full-wave study to a COMSOL model that uses metal sheets.

The model comes from
:func:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol_sheet.build_comsol_sheet_model`: air and silicon
meeting at ``z = 0`` with the layout's metal imprinted on that plane as faces.
This module makes those faces perfect electric conductors, turns the two feed
cross sections into numeric ports, and adds a mesh sequence and a frequency
study. Nothing is meshed or solved here.

The port faces and the integration line are found from the feed ports and the
bounding box of the :class:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol_layout.ComsolLayout`, never
from hard-coded entity IDs, so a layout whose feeds do not sit on opposite
bounding-box faces is refused instead of quietly porting the wrong plane.

What a solve gives is the S-parameters of the CPW section between the two
planes: ``emw.S21dB`` is the through response at ``frequency_ghz``,
``emw.S11dB`` the reflection. It is not an eigenmode solve, so it says nothing
about a qubit hanging off the feedline.
