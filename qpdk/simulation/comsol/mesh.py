"""Mesh helpers for COMSOL sheet models.

Both COMSOL notebooks build a study on the same sheet geometry and then want one
more thing from the mesh: the element count after a local refinement at the
metal plane, to check that a solved quantity has stopped moving with mesh size.
The sequence is the same in both, so it lives here once.

The study builders (:func:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.rf.add_cpw_rf_study` and
:func:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.capacitance.add_capacitance_study`) leave
``mesh1`` physics-controlled. Running it once realizes that sizing; a ``Refine``
feature then switches the sequence to user-controlled, and the second run meshes
the refined box.

:func:`pin_absolute_mesh_sizes` is for the other kind of study, where the mesh
must not follow the domain at all. A physics-controlled mesh scales its element
sizes with the longest dimension of the domain, so a series that varies the
distance to the boundary would vary the near-metal resolution with it.

:func:`pin_absolute_edge_mesh_sizes` is the same idea one dimension down: the
local sizes go on a named edge selection instead of conductor faces, for a study
whose resolution has to follow a trace outline rather than cover a whole face.
