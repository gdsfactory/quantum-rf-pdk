"""Launcher component for RF applications.

This module provides a launcher component for RF wirebonding and probe testing.
The launcher consists of a straight section connected to a tapered section,
transitioning from a large cross-section suitable for probing to a smaller
cross-section for circuit integration.

    Creates a launcher component consisting of a straight section with large
    cross-section connected to a tapered transition down to a smaller cross-section.
    This design facilitates RF signal access through probes or wirebonds while
    maintaining good impedance matching.

    The default dimensions are taken from :cite:`tuokkolaMethodsAchieveNearmillisecond2025`.

    Args:
        straight_length: Length of the straight, wirebond landing area, section in micrometers.
        taper_length: Length of the taper section in micrometers.

            of the launcher (circuit interface).
