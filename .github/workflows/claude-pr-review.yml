            Please review this pull request with a focus on:

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            Note the following guidelines for your review:
            - Do not write positive feedback or general comments. Only provide constructive criticism and actionable feedback. If there are no issues, no need to comment.
            - Get familiar with the codebase by reading ./AGENTS.md in the repo root.
            - You are called on new commits to the PR, so focus on the latest changes and how they integrate with the existing code. Avoid redundant comments on unchanged code.

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
