    :description: Circuit-model hierarchy and AEDT simulation wrappers for QPDK components.

*******************************
 Circuit-level model hierarchy
*******************************

SAX simulations expand unmodeled assemblies until they reach cells with declared models.
Model declarations therefore define hierarchy boundaries instead of relying on a fixed
depth.

Coupled resonators declare their own models so the coupling is preserved. Chip
assemblies remain unmodeled and expand to these boundaries and other modeled primitives.

For new components, attach the compact model through ``schematic_function`` and keep its
``port_order`` consistent with the layout ports.
