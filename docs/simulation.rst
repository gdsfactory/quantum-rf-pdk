    :description: Circuit-model hierarchy and AEDT simulation wrappers for QPDK components.

*******************************
 Circuit-level model hierarchy
*******************************

SAX simulations expand unmodeled assemblies until they reach cells with declared models.
Model declarations therefore define hierarchy boundaries instead of relying on a fixed
depth.

Coupled resonators declare their own models so the coupling is preserved. Chip
assemblies remain unmodeled and expand to these boundaries and other modeled primitives.

For new components, attach the compact model through ``schematic_function`` and keep its
``port_order`` consistent with the layout ports.

 COMSOL
********

The generic COMSOL code lives in :mod:`gplugins.comsol`; the modules below are thin QPDK
wrappers around it. :mod:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.layout` inverts the QPDK mask into
metal before the gplugins extraction, the sheet builder and
:class:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL` default to the QPDK technology
permittivities, and the study, mesh, plotting, and result modules re-export gplugins
unchanged.

The builders below return a plain MPh model. Study and local refinement helpers take
that model and its layout; absolute mesh helpers use the model and named selections.
:class:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL` wraps the two in one object: it subclasses
:class:`mph.Model`, so MPh solves, saves, and evaluates it as usual, and it holds the
layout, so a setup reads as a chain.

1. Build with :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.create_sheet` or
   :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.create_metal`
2. Add a study with :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.add_cpw_rf_study` or
   :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.add_capacitance_study`
3. Mesh it with :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.refine_metal_plane_mesh`,
   :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.pin_absolute_mesh_sizes`, or
   :meth:`~qpdk.simulation.comsol.model.COMSOL.pin_absolute_edge_mesh_sizes`
4. Solve, save, and evaluate with MPh's own ``solve``, ``save``, and ``evaluate``

Every helper here, including the layout, plotting, and result helpers, needs the
``comsol`` extra, which installs ``gplugins[comsol]``; building and solving a model also
needs COMSOL. The modules import without the extra and raise an :class:`ImportError`
naming ``uv sync --extra comsol`` when a helper is used.
